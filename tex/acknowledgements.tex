\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{cha:ack}
This thesis is by far the most interesting project I've ever had to work on in my young career. Never would I have thought I would be working on such an impressive private spacecraft project as part of my studies. As such, I would like to thank my program managers Guillaume Lemieux, Stéphane Belzile and François Arsenault for their trust and for having given me the green light. A huge thank you  to the whole Dream Chaser team at MDA is also in order. They supported me very well, even with the home office situation. Precisely, I would like to mention my team lead Claudio Discepola for following me through my million questions, as well as Matthieu Ippersiel who seemed to always hold the solution to my bizarre problems.
