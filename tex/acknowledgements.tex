\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{cha:ack}
This thesis is by far the most interesting project I've ever had to work on in my young career. Never would I have thought I would be working on such an impressive private spacecraft project as part of my studies. As such, I would like to thank my program managers Guillaume Lemieux, Stéphane Belzile and François Arsenault for trusting me. A huge thank you is also in order to the whole Dream Chaser team at MDA that constantly supported me, even with the home office situation. Precisely, I would like to mention my team lead Claudio Discepola for following me through my million questions, as well as Matthieu Ippersiel who seemed to always hold the solutions to my bizarre problems.
