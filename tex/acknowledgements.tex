\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{cha:ack}
This thesis is by far the most interesting project I've ever had to work on in my young career. Never would I have thought I would be working on such an impressive private spacecraft project as part of my studies. As such, I would like to thank my program managers Guillaume Lemieux and Fran√ßois Arsenault for their trust and for having given me the green light. A huge thank you to the whole Dream Chaser team at MDA is also in order. They supported me very well, even with the home office situation. Precisely, I would like to mention my team leads Claudio Discepola and Fatima Zahra Tazi, my technical mentor Martin Servant, as well as Matthieu Ippersiel and Frederic Lamer, who seemed to always hold the solutions to my bizarre problems.
