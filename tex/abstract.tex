\chapter*{Abstract}\label{cha:abstract}
Functional simulations form an integral part of the testing phase in space projects. For the communications subsystem of the Dream Chaser spacecraft, a snapshotting feature for its software-in-the-loop test framework had to be developed, akin to virtual machine programs. Using concepts in existing software, this thesis shows how the flight software could be checkpointed, without modifying its code, by injecting thread-checkpointing code at compile time and cataloging its variables at build time. After an artifact file with an appropriate format was produced, it was possible for the environment to get fully restored by manipulating execution stack frames to reconstruct the flight threads, while rebuilding simulation modules. The results are then showed to be fulfilling both customer and user performance requirements.
